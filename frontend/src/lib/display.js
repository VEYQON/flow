// Model-chosen text, made safe to READ. The panel's one escaping rule, and the only one it may have.
//
// The engine already has this rule: `flow/lib/agent.py` defines `_escaped` and exports it as
// `escape_for_display`, and says in as many words that a second escaper elsewhere in the codebase
// would be a second rule and the first thing to drift. That helper is **Python-side only**. It runs
// when the engine composes the approval question, so the question's own sentence arrives at the
// panel already escaped — and the arguments beside it do not, because they are shipped as data and
// rendered by the panel itself. There is no way for the panel to call the Python helper: the values
// it renders come out of its own store, not out of a request it makes per value.
//
// So the JS side needs the same rule in one place, and this module is that place: a faithful port,
// character for character, of `_escaped` and of `_for_display` in `flow/tools/builtins.py`. It is
// deliberately a port and not an improvement. If the two ever have to differ, the difference is a
// defect in one of them.
//
// WHY, in one sentence: Vue's mustache escapes HTML and nothing else, so a newline in a value draws
// a real line inside the approval card, a right-to-left override reorders the sentence around it
// while adding no character, and a zero-width joiner is invisible by definition. Each is a way to
// show a person a question other than the one being asked, on the one surface whose whole job is to
// be trustworthy.

// The whitelist, and it has to stay one. `\p{C}` is every Other category (Cc control, Cf format,
// Cn unassigned, Co private use, Cs surrogate) and `\p{Z}` every Separator (Zs space, Zl line,
// Zp paragraph) — exactly the `C*`/`Z*` test the engine makes with `unicodedata.category(ch)[0]`.
// The engine's docstring records how it got here: the rule began as the categories that looked
// dangerous, Cc and Cf, and that list missed U+2028 and U+2029, which every layout engine treats as
// line breaks. A whitelist means a later revision of Unicode cannot quietly add a new way through.
//
// `\p{Default_Ignorable_Code_Point}` is the third term and it was MISSING, which a reviewer caught
// by measuring rather than by reading: 267 code points carry that property and are in neither C*
// nor Z*, so every one of them came through raw AND UNQUOTED — without even the quote that is
// supposed to be the signal that something was escaped. The property means precisely what this
// module is defending against: "a conformant renderer paints nothing here". Four of the 267 are
// category `Lo`, LETTERS (U+115F, U+1160, U+3164, U+FFA0), so no rule about controls, formats,
// separators or combining marks was ever going to reach them, and `SO-0001` beside
// `SO-0001<U+3164>` is two different writes that a reader cannot tell apart.
//
// It takes in the variation selectors (U+FE00-FE0F, U+E0100-E01EF) as well, and that is a decision
// rather than an oversight: an argument holding an emoji written with U+FE0F now renders quoted,
// as `"...\ufe0f"`. Slightly uglier, and correct — the cost of the other choice is a class of
// invisible character judged safe by whoever last thought about it, which is the mistake this
// whitelist exists to make impossible. The escape is visible and reversible; nothing is stripped.

// THE ONE DELIBERATE EXCEPTION, and it is a port of `_spells_rather_than_hides` in

// apps. U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER carries `Default_Ignorable_Code_Point`, so the rule above marks
// it — correctly for every script that does not use it. In Sinhala, Tamil, Devanagari and every
// other Indic script the joiner is SPELLING: a conjunct is written CONSONANT + VIRAMA + ZWJ +
// CONSONANT, so `ශ්‍රී` is one word and marking the joiner inside it drops
// six characters of machine escape into the middle of it. The defence that exists so a person can
// read what they are approving was making the text unreadable for the people who read it.
//
// A joiner is kept ONLY when all four hold, and each clause refuses a shape an attacker uses:
//   1. it is at neither edge of the value — a joiner with nothing on one side joins nothing;
//   2. a VIRAMA sits immediately before it — that is what makes it orthography;
//   3. a LETTER sits immediately after it — which also disposes of the doubled and the run cases,
//      because the code point after the first joiner of VIRAMA ZWJ ZWJ LETTER is a joiner;
//   4. the two neighbours share a 128-code-point aligned block — without this,
//      `SO-000A` + DEVANAGARI VIRAMA + ZWJ + `x` satisfies 1 to 3 while the joiner binds nothing.
// The Indic blocks are laid out by the standard on exactly that grid. A script the clause cannot
// see keeps NO exception, which is where it was before: the rule fails closed.
