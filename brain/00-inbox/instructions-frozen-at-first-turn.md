# Agent instruction edits don't reach existing sessions

**Problem:** `_persist_turn` (`flow_session.py:209`) stores the agent's instructions as the session's
system message on the first turn. Editing an agent's instructions afterwards changes only new sessions.

## Evidence
Read in upstream 4a3189b, 19 Sep 2026. Directly affects rolling out the revised Agent Q prompt.

## Open questions
- Should the system message be rebuilt from the agent record each turn (ephemeral), like memory?
- What should happen to a long-running session when instructions change mid-conversation?
