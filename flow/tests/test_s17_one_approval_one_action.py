"""S17 — one approval answers one action.

Every decision the engine makes about a tool call is keyed by that call's reference: which calls
are still pending, which question a person is answering, which call an answer resolves. When two
calls in one model reply cannot be told apart by that reference, all three collapse onto one. The
interface stamps one card, a person approves one action, and two happen.

Two calls cannot be told apart in two ways, and they fail identically downstream:

  - they carry the same id;
  - neither carries a usable one. A provider sending ``{"id": null}`` twice, or a gateway that
    omits the field, or a stream that never delivers it, all produce a turn whose calls share the
    empty reference. Nothing in the engine refused that before, and it is the likelier shape.

Such a turn is REFUSED — nothing runs, nothing is written, and the turn never enters the
transcript — and a stored transcript already carrying one cannot be resumed.

What these tests do NOT cover, said plainly rather than left to be inferred: the `auto_approve`
switch and the order in which a batch executes. Both are separate known defects with their own
entries, and nothing here changes either.

No permission surface, with one exception: every test here but one drives `flow/lib/agent.py` with
a fake model and reads no document, so the named-non-Administrator rule does not apply.
`TestASessionWhoseHistoryIsPoisonedStaysUsable` does create a `Flow Session` and its message rows,
and runs as Administrator deliberately: what it measures is whether a stored transcript can still be
replayed at all, and no permission rule is under test in it.
