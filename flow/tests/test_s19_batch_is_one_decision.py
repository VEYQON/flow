"""S19 Part A — a batch is one decision.

The model can ask for several tools in one reply. Before this change the engine ran them one by
one and only decided to pause after the last of them, so every ungated call in a pausing turn had
already executed by the time the person saw the question. They were asked about the write having
already had the read done in their name — and a Deny undid nothing and said nothing.

Now nothing in a turn runs if anything in that turn will ask a person: the calls nobody was asked
about are held back and execute on resume, in their original order, after the answers are in.

Every tool here records its own calls, so "nothing ran" is asserted against a list rather than
inferred from the shape of a result.

		`question_keys` is read by `announce` and by three branches of the ladder, all comparing a

		string IS the sentinel — so folding the keys moved two of those decisions, and one of them
		wrote the CALLER'S OWN ANSWER TEXT into the transcript as that tool's result, which is the
		exact harm the branch above it exists to prevent. The keys are no longer folded; the record
		being non-empty is what the guard reads, and it reads it from `asked`, not from a sentinel.
