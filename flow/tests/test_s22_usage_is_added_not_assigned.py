"""What a turn's counts add up to, and whether the reply was answered by what was asked for.

Two defects, one of them live and one of them a hole where a number should be.

C4 — `_accumulate_usage` summed three hard-coded names and dropped every other count a call
reported. A turn with a tool call makes more than one call, so any further count — a cost, a
cached-input count, a count of calls answered by something else — survived from the first call of
the turn and from none of the others. The natural repair is worse than the bug: "sum what we know,
create what we do not" is written `if key in total: continue`, and that guard skips a key precisely
once it has something to add to. Assignment wearing the shape of addition, understating by more the
more work is done.

H2 — cost is worked out against the rate for the thing that was ASKED FOR, while the money was spent
on whatever actually answered. Those differ whenever an administrator-set fallback fires, and the
request keyword dictionary is built so that anything the client library accepts flows straight
through. Nothing captured that they had differed, so the figure could be labelled with the most
authoritative source the record has and still be a figure for a different thing.

	Pricing one needs a cached rate to price it AGAINST, and the rate table is a doctype in another
	repository whose seven fields do not include one. Capturing the number here would therefore put a
	count in the record that nothing can turn into money — and the review's own instruction is that
	capturing a number and not using it is the one option not available, because the moment it exists
	someone reads it as evidence the estimate accounts for caching when the estimate does not.

	Dropping it also keeps the shipped caveat true. The caveat says an estimate cannot see cached
	input; that sentence stops being honest the day this side starts seeing it, and the caveat is not
	in this repository to amend.

	SO THIS IS NOT A TEST OF NOTHING. `_accumulate_usage` now sums EVERY key it is handed, which is
	what makes the drop fragile in a way it was not before: one line added to `_normalize` and a
	cached count flows all the way to the stored record with no further edit and no review. This pins
	the shape of what the engine emits so that line cannot land quietly. It fails RED when a cached
	count is captured — proved by mutation, not assumed.

	The exact platform-side change that would let this decision be reversed, recorded so that reversing
	it is a known piece of work rather than a discovery: add `cached_input_per_1k` (Currency) to
	`Veyqon Model Rate`'s `field_order`; price `(prompt_tokens - cached_prompt_tokens)` at the full
	input rate plus `cached_prompt_tokens` at the cached rate; and resolve a rate row that has no
	cached rate to `unpriceable` / `no-cached-rate` whenever the cached count is non-zero, rather than
	silently pricing it at full rate. Until all three exist, capturing the count is premature.
