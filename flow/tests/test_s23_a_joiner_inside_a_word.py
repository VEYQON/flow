"""A joiner that spells a word is not a joiner that hides one.

THE DEFECT THIS MODULE WAS WRITTEN AGAINST. `_escaped` marks every code point carrying Unicode's
`Default_Ignorable_Code_Point` property, and U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER carries it. In Sinhala, Tamil,
Devanagari and every other Indic script the joiner is not decoration: a conjunct is spelled
CONSONANT + VIRAMA + ZWJ + CONSONANT, so `\u0dc1\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0dd3` — the first word of this
company's own country — arrived on the approval card as `\u0dc1\u0dca\\u200d\u0dbb\u0dd3`, six
characters of machine escape dropped into the middle of a word. The defence meant to stop a person
approving something they could not read was making the text unreadable for the people who read it.

WHAT IS ADOPTED, AND FROM WHERE. Two sibling front ends had already decided this and tested it —
`agentq-web/src/features/chat/lib/visibleControls.ts` and its character-for-character twin in
`veyqon-web`, both at `joinsRatherThanHides`: *"a joiner that FOLLOWS a virama is orthography, not
hiding, and is kept."* This module does not invent a policy; it ports one, and then tightens it,
because the front ends' version never looks at what comes AFTER the joiner and so keeps a joiner
with nothing to join.

THE RULE, WHOLE. A joiner — U+200C ZWNJ or U+200D ZWJ — is left as itself, unescaped, only when
every one of these holds:
  1. it is neither the first nor the last code point of the value;
  2. the code point immediately before it is a VIRAMA (canonical combining class 9);
  3. the code point immediately after it is a LETTER (general category L*);
  4. those two neighbours lie in the same 128-code-point aligned block.
Everything else is escaped exactly as it was before: a joiner at either edge, a doubled joiner, a
joiner in a run, a joiner beside a space or a bracket, a joiner between two ordinary letters, and
every other character the escaper has ever marked.

WHY EACH CLAUSE IS THERE, since a rule nobody can justify is a rule the next person will widen:
  - (1) and (3) are the shape of the attack. A joiner with nothing on one side of it is joining
    nothing; it is only hiding. They also dispose of the doubled and the run cases for free, because
    the code point after the first joiner in `VIRAMA ZWJ ZWJ LETTER` is a joiner, which is not a
    letter.
  - (2) is what makes it orthography rather than decoration, and it is READ FROM THE LIBRARY —
    `unicodedata.combining(ch) == 9` is Unicode's own Virama combining class. The front ends write
    out sixteen viramas by hand; measured here on UCD 16.0.0 there are SIXTY-NINE, so their list is
    a strict subset missing fifty-three, which is the same table-drift this whole change is about.
  - (4) is the one clause the front ends do not have at all, and it closes a hole they still carry.
    Without it `SO-000A\u094d\u200dx` — a Latin letter, a Devanagari virama, a joiner, a Latin `x`
    — satisfies every other clause while the joiner forms no conjunct with anything, so it is purely
    hidden. A virama binds the letter beside it in its OWN script.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO, SAID PLAINLY. It changes what is DISPLAYED and nothing else. The arguments
the tool receives are the model's own bytes, before and after this change alike, and
`TestTheValueThatRUNSIsUntouched` asserts that through a real approved call rather than by reading
the code.

NOT TOUCHED BY THIS MODULE: `_invoke`, `_resolve_confirmation`, `_confirmation_question` and
`_has_denial` (CLAUDE.md rule 4). `_escaped` gains one branch; no second escaper is created.

	point, so string injectivity is unconditional. With `_spells_rather_than_hides` mutated to
	`return True`, the whole defence removed and every joiner kept raw, all three tests stayed
	green, including one named `keeps "paid" and "paid<ZWJ>" apart` at the moment those two
	displayed identically. CLAUDE.md, in as many words: a gate whose failure mode has never been
	observed is a comment.

	What matters is not that the strings differ. It is that they differ **in characters a renderer
	paints**. `_painted` below is written HERE, in the test, from the note's own §2 table rather
	than imported from the code under test — an inverse supplied by the code under test would agree
	with any escaper, including a broken one.

	AND THE ONE PLACE THAT IS NOT TRUE IS THE EXCEPTION ITSELF, which is why the pairs are in two
	lists. A conjunct joiner is invisible BY DESIGN: `ශ්ර` and `ශ්‍ර`
	differ only by it, and what distinguishes them on screen is that a conformant Sinhala renderer
	draws the second as a touching conjunct and the first as two separate letters. A test cannot see
	a font. So those pairs are named, one by one, as the DECLARED COST of the exception — and every

	"""FOUND WHILE PROVING THE ABOVE, RECORDED, AND DELIBERATELY NOT FIXED HERE.

	`_confirmation_question` builds its fallback body as `json.dumps(call.arguments, indent=2,
	default=str)` (`flow/lib/agent.py`), and `json.dumps` defaults to `ensure_ascii=True`. So on
	the commonest card of all — a gated tool with neither a `confirm_prompt` nor a
	`confirm_template` — EVERY non-ASCII character is escaped, not merely the joiner: a Sinhala
	value arrives as twenty-odd backslash-u sequences and a Tamil one likewise. The fix above cannot
	reach it, because that dump never passes through `_escaped` at all.

	WHY IT IS NOT FIXED IN THIS COMMIT, and this is not reluctance:
	  - `_confirmation_question` is one of the four functions CLAUDE.md rule 4 protects: "no change
	    without a spec that names it." The brief for this run names the marking code and the
	    joiner; it does not name this function.
	  - The obvious one-word change is WRONG AND UNSAFE. `ensure_ascii=False` alone would put a
	    RIGHT-TO-LEFT OVERRIDE straight onto the card unescaped, because `ensure_ascii=True` is
	    today the only thing escaping it on this path. The correct change is to build the body from
	    `_quoted_argument` instead of from `json.dumps`, which is a design change to a load-bearing
	    function and needs its own spec.

	These two tests PIN the present behaviour so that nobody changes it by accident and so that the
	day someone writes that spec, the tests that must flip are already named.
