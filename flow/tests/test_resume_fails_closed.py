"""S15 — an approval must never be silently swallowed.

A person is shown an approval question and answers it. By the time the run resumes, the tool the
question was about may not be in the runtime any more — removed, renamed or disabled while the run
was paused — or it may no longer be gated at all. Before this change, both of those fell into the
branch written for an ordinary answered question and the person's own answer string was recorded
as that tool call's result. Nothing ran, nothing was denied, and the model was handed the word
"Approve" as though a tool had returned it.

Every tool here records its own calls, so "nothing executed" is asserted against a list rather than
inferred from the result shape, and every assertion about what the model was told reads the
transcript rather than the result object.
