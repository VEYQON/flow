# Run the scenarios inside a platform context, which is what `_()` in the engine needs.
#
# The runner itself is plain Python and makes no request of its own; this only supplies the
# import context the engine expects. Arguments pass straight through:
#   evals/run.sh                                  all scenarios
#   evals/run.sh --scenario deny_stops_the_batch
#   evals/run.sh --list                           (prints names; there is no verdict to give)
#
# It does NOT trust the wrapped command's exit code — that lesson is in CLAUDE.md and it applies
# here for the same reason. The verdict is read out of the runner's own summary line, and a missing
# summary is a failure, not a pass.
