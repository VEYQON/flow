"""Run the agent-loop scenarios in this process against a scripted model.

There is no network here, no credential, and no real model. The runner builds a code `Agent`
around `ScriptedModel` below and never constructs the platform's own model class, so there is no
code path from here to a provider. `assert_no_real_model()` refuses to start if the environment
suggests otherwise.

These scenarios test the plumbing — which tool is called, whether approval is asked for, what the
exact "Approve" does and what "Deny" and free text do. They say nothing about whether a real model
would choose well. See README.md.
